What I have learnt 
Dynamic Programming: algorithmic technique used to optimize recursive solutions
Dynamic programming can be achieved using two approaches:
-top-down approach, also known as memoization, we keep the solution recursive and add a memoization table to avoid repeated calls of same subproblems.
-bottom-up approach, also known as tabulation, we start with the smallest subproblems
