# leetCodeProblems
I plan to make a repository where I plan to tackle solutions for a month.

# Based on ChatGPT
ðŸ“… Week 1 (Feb 9 - Feb 15) 
â†’ Arrays, Strings, and Hashing (Most Common Topics)
These problems test your ability to manipulate data efficiently.

Two Sum (Easy) â†’ HashMap usage, common in interviews.

Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Easy) â†’ Sliding window, optimal subarray.

Product of Array Except Self (Medium) â†’ Prefix/suffix product trick.

Valid Anagram (Easy) â†’ String manipulation, sorting, and hashmaps.

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium) â†’ Sliding window, hash set.

Group Anagrams (Medium) â†’ HashMap, sorting strings.

Valid Parentheses (Easy) â†’ Stack usage, commonly tested.


ðŸ“… Week 2 (Feb 16 - Feb 22) â†’ Linked Lists, Recursion, and Binary Search
These are crucial for technical assessments and problem-solving.

Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy) â†’ Linked List merging, recursion.

Reverse Linked List (Easy) â†’ Iterative and recursive solutions.

ðŸ“… Week 3 (Feb 23 - Feb 29) â†’ Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming
These topics are often tested in interviews and require strong problem-solving.

Invert Binary Tree (Easy) â†’ Recursion, BFS/DFS.

Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST (Easy) â†’ Tree traversal.

Balanced Binary Tree (Easy) â†’ Recursive depth checking.

Climbing Stairs (Easy) â†’ Fibonacci sequence, dynamic programming.

# Why This List?
These problems frequently appear in graduate role interviews.
Covers arrays, strings, hash maps, binary search, recursion, graphs, trees, and DPâ€”all core CS topics.
Balances easy, medium, and some harder problems to build problem-solving skills progressively.
